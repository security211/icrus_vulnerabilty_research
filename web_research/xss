Special Characters for Comand Injection

cmd1|cmd2  : Uses of | will make command 2 to be executed weather command 1 execution is successful or not.
cmd1;cmd2  : Uses of ; will make command 2 to be executed weather command 1 execution is successful or not.
cmd1||cmd2  : Command 2 will only be executed if command 1 execution fails.
cmd1&&cmd2 : Command 2 will only be executed if command 1 execution succeeds.
$(cmd) : For example, echo $(whoami) or $(touch test.sh; echo 'ls' > test.sh)
